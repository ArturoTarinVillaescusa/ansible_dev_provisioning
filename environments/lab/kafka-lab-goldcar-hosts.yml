    # Security Modes

    # The Ansible playbooks for Confluent Platform currently support the following security modes:

    #     plaintext:       if you have no requirements for a secured environment.
    #     ssl:             if you require only SSL encryption and would like the playbook to create the certificates for you.
    #     sasl_ssl:        if you require plaintext SASL authentication and SSL encryption, and would like the playbook to
    #                      create the certificates for you.
    #     ssl_customcerts: if you require only SSL encryption, but want to use your own self-signed or CA certificates.
    #     kerberos_ssl:    if you require SSL encryption and would like the playbook to create the certificates, and you
    #                      want Kerberos authentication using your own KDC and keytabs.
    #     kerberos:        if you require Kerberos authentication and are providing your own KDC and keytabs.
    #     kerberos_ssl_customcerts: if you require SSL encryption and are providing your own certificates, and require
    #                               Kerberos authentication using your own KDC and keytabs.
